 Populates a table with data from the new Twitch.tv API about the 10 or so most popular PUBG streamers. Streamers are hard coded into the call, so this will eventually become outdated as they move on to streaming other games.

Streamers that are currently online are moved to the top of the list. An orange [PUBG] tag appears under the names of streamers that are currently streaming PUBG, otherwise they are streaming some other game. The stream title and viewer count are also listed for online streamers.

Clicking on a row will take you to that streamers channel, even if they are offline.
